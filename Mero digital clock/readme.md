The script begins by importing the necessary libraries: tkinter for the GUI, datetime for handling date and time, and time for delaying the clock update. Then, it defines a function to get the Nepali year by adding 56 to the Gregorian year and converting it to Nepali digits using a dictionary.The main function retrieves the current date and time in the Gregorian calendar using datetime.datetime.now(). It then calculates the Nepali year by adding 56 to the Gregorian year and converts it to Nepali digits.

The script adjusts the Nepali month and day by adding 8 and 16 respectively to the Gregorian month and day. If the adjusted Nepali day exceeds the maximum days in the Nepali month, it increments the month and adjusts the day accordingly.The month and day are converted to their Nepali representations using predefined lists for Nepali months and days.Next, it retrieves the current hour, minute, and second in Nepali digits.The day of the week is calculated based on the Unix epoch as a reference and converted to Nepali representation using a predefined list.

Finally, the script creates a Tkinter window with a label to display the clock. It updates the clock label with the current time and starts a loop to continuously update the clock every second using time.sleep(1) and update_clock() function.
